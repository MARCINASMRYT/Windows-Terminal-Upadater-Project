Features
- Simulates a command prompt environment.
- Prompts the user to enter commands.
- Provides feedback based on user input.
- Automatically deletes itself after the second execution.
- How It Works
1. **Execution Count**: The script keeps track of how many times it has been run using a counter stored in a file named `counter.txt`.
2. **Self-Deletion**: After the second execution, the script deletes itself and the counter file, ensuring it won't run again.
3. **User  Interaction**: Users can enter commands, and the script will respond accordingly, adding a humorous touch to the interaction.
 Usage:
1. Download the `WINDOWS_TERMINAL_2.0.bat` file.
2. Place it in a directory where you have write permissions.
3. Run the batch file by double-clicking it.
4. Follow the prompts and enter commands as desired.
5. After the second execution, the batch file will delete itself.
Important Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to delete files in the directory where the batch file is located.
- The script is intended for educational and entertainment purposes.
